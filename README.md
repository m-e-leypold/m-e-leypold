Repositories in my Github account will be migrated to
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/m-e-leypold) in the coming months
(May - June 2024). All my development on Github will cease. Finally
the repositories will be deleted.

Rationale: I take offence at Github's terms of service that
(IMHO underhandedly) take out a right for them to train their (closed
source) AI products on my GPL licensed source. See 

- [ToS, 4. License Grant to us](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#4-license-grant-to-us)
- [About GitHub Copilot
  Individual](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-individual/about-github-copilot-individual),
  specifically "(...) GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that
  appear in public repositories. (...)".
  
Personally I hold the opinion that trained LLMs / neural networks /
whatever are derived works of the training material they ingest. 

I will (it seems) have a hard time enforcing the GPL based on my
reading, but this doesn't make the act of appropriating the work of
creators intended for the allmende less morally reprehensible. Might
does not make right.

I am done with Github (and Gitlab, for the same reason).
